## Details
 **Description:** These huge pieces of cross-legged beef are now placed in a pot of soup rather than in a small bowl. Not only does this increase the portion size, but there is now room to boil other ingredients alongside the beef. However, this particular pot of food still seems rather raw.

 **Quality:** <span style="color: #0000CD">OK</span>

 **Type:** Event related
