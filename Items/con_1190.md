## Details
 **Description:** A wide assortment of seafood has been added to a porridge base boiled from pork bone stock and scallops. All sorts of seafood have been added to this dish, from fish to shrimp to crab to shellfish, and they all taste incredibly fresh after being blanched. This dish is an artistic interpretation of the Guangdong perspective on food. However, this particular pot of food still seems rather raw.
