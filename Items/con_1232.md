## Details
 **Description:** Goose oil is added to a master stock made from a variety of Chinese herbs and medicines, giving this dish a soul. Fresh goose intestines, foie gras, and goose gizzards are cooked in this stock. The more you eat, the more fragrant it seems. This particular pot of food still seems rather raw.

 **Quality:** <span style="color: #0000CD">OK</span>

 **Type:** Event related
