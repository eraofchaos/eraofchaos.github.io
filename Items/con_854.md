## Details
 **Description:** This hotpot evolved from a traditional snack eaten in Hainan. Sour vinegar dregs left behind from spirit brewing operations are used to make this soup base. A variety of seafood and vegetables are added to this slightly spicy and sweet dish that has a distinctive taste. This particular pot of food seems to be insufficiently heated.
