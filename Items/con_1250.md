## Details
 **Description:** This hotpot evolved from a traditional snack eaten in Hainan. Sour vinegar dregs left behind from spirit brewing operations are used to make this soup base. A variety of seafood and vegetables are added to this slightly spicy and sweet dish that has a distinctive taste. This particular pot of food still seems rather raw.

 **Quality:** <span style="color: #0000CD">OK</span>
